# Tyler's MyReads Project

The MyReads project creates a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. Search for books to add to your reading list. Modify your book list straight from the search page. 

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) was used to bootstrap the project.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
